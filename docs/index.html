<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Catalog Description</h4>
<p>Focus on the concepts, aesthetics, processes, and practice of designing and producing 3D computer animation. Theory
and techniques of cinematography, video production and sound as related to 3D computer animation will be
covered.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Course Learning Objectives</h4>
<p>This course is an introduction and integration of traditional design tools, camera, and digital technologies for application to
multidisciplinary visual thinking, design, communication, and art. Throughout the semester, we will examine the language
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
and histories of 3D animation and how artists have contributed to and utilized them in their work. We will explore, compare,
and contrast industry-standard/normative approaches with radical/experimental takes of these various media.
Our aim is to establish a rich understanding of the complex and evolving environment in which artists and
designers have been creating 3D animation. Students will explore technical, critical, and creative tools to realize
animation projects and to gain a deeper understanding of digital moving images as a medium of expression and
communication.
</p> 
<p>Through a series of exercises, projects, readings, and screenings, we will explore and study the following: </p> 

<ul class="itemize1">     
<li class="itemize">Principles of 3D animation: timing, perspective, change, and aesthetics.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Fundamentals of motion and animation: attributes, keyframes, interpolation, and blending.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Fundamentals of digital video files: codecs, resolution, raster/vector, and conversion.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Means of exhibition and presentation: screening, immersive environment, web-based, and projection mapping
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Principles of cinematography, video production, motion graphics &#x0026; audio with 3D computer animation
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Techniques of 3D animation: rigging, procedural, dynamic, and simulation animations</li></ul>
<p>We will explore the field through lectures, readings, screenings, discussions, and student presentations. By the
end of the semester, students should have gained essential production and postproduction skills as well as a
good understanding of the key concepts relevant to contemporary film, video, new media, installation, and 3D
animation.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Health and Safety Requirements</h4>
<p>All students, faculty and staff are required to comply with and stay up to date on all <a 
href="https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank" >university safety and
health guidance</a>, which includes wearing a face mask in any indoor space and maintaining a safe physical
distance at all times. Non-compliance will be warned first and disciplinary actions will be taken for repeated
offenses.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Format &#x0026; Delivery</h4>
<p>This is a hands-on, process-oriented studio. It is comprised of presentations, assignments, participatory activities and
exercises, individual and group discussions, and reviews. This course is <span class="texthl"><span id="textcolor1">hybrid or in-person</span></span>. Synchronous Zoom meetings
will be used for the introduction of assignments, some demonstrations, breakout group meetings, and group
critique discussions. Other activities such as working on assignments and exercises, viewing videos, and reading
assignments will be executed synchronously and asynchronously. In-person activities will include demonstrations,
presentations, group exercises, and critiques. Weekly announcements will serve to inform when activities will take
place.
</p> 

                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
A hybrid course provides online learning opportunities for up to 74% of the semester. That means that up to three-fourths of
your in-class meeting time may occur at a distance with the expectation that your full attention will be given to this course
during the scheduled two hour and forty minute long meeting times, regardless if you are meeting physically or
otherwise.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Attendance</h4>
<p>Each unexcused absence (beyong the allowed three) will result in one full letter grade deduction (e.g. B+ to C+). Six
unexcused absences (20% of the semester) results in a failed grade. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, contact
us beforehand. Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If
you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. Any disputes
should be discussed within two weeks.
</p> 

<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
The Department of Art acknowledges that illness, family obligations, and other conflicts with your classes do occur from time
to time and up to three absences are allowed for any reason during the semester without penalty. <span class="textul">All absences from class will
be counted, however, and in the instance that you miss three class meetings, you are required to meet us to discuss strategies
for avoiding additional absences</span>.
</p> 

<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
It has been determined that some in-person learning is necessary for you to successfully engage your instructor and peers,
course activities, and to meet learning objectives. Timely and consistent contributions are critical in all formats used to
deliver the content of this course. In the instance of class-wide quarantine or campus closure, a course contingency plan has
been designed so that we can transition to an exclusively on-line format if we are required to actuate one. <span class="textul">Attendance will be
taken regardless of delivery format.</span>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>Participation</h4>
<p>Attendance, productive class activity and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the assessment of your progress. You
are expected to be present and active for the entire class period. Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do
the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class meetings and discussions, offer feedback during
critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and
taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and
identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be
willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
know.
</p> 
<p><a 
 id="communication"></a>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a>Communication</h4>
<p><a 
href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank" >Discord</a> is used as our primary mode of communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a 
href="https://discord.gg/yk3qpfvbmj" target="_blank" >server</a>, and keep
up to date with announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings, screenings, and
learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-12000"></a>Discord Server Interaction</h4>
<p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord <a 
href="https://discord.gg/yk3qpfvbmj" target="_blank" >server</a> is required. We will use Discord to gather and share
resources, respond to readings and peers’ works, and to share your work in progress.
</p> 
<p>Throughout the semester students will submit a variety of posts to our Discord server, among them: </p> 

<ul class="itemize1">     
<li class="itemize">Responses to readings in text, rendered stills, sketches, or animation.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Exercise submissions as <code>.blend</code> files, video links (uploaded to Youtube or Vimeo), rendered stills, etc.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">Project proposals in PDF format or as Word documents.</li></ul>
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-13000"></a>Readings &#x0026; Discussions</h4>
<p>During the semester, you will be assigned readings on a variety of topics. The readings are intended to familiarize you with
some of the relevant discussions that relate to the field. We will discuss our findings and thoughts with our peers in class.
Your participation in these discussions matters. The discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn
from one another and explore the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a foundation for
discussing the screenings, which are purposefully picked to convey some of the ideas from the readings in
practice.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a>Projects</h4>
<p>Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to one week late for a one letter
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are
still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, software
errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your desktop, online, and/or on an external harddrive
or USB stick in case your computer is lost.
</p> 
<p>

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20000"></a>Course Materials and Tools</h4>
<p>Our course heavily relies on free, open-source, and libre software. Throughout the semester we will explore modeling,
rendering, and animation primarily using <a 
href="http://blender.org/" target="_blank" >Blender</a>, while also discussing other established and emerging software such as
<a 
href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html" target="_blank" >Adobe After Effects</a>, <a 
href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/" target="_blank" >Unreal Engine</a>, <a 
href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank" >Unity</a>, and <a 
href="https://www.daz3d.com/" target="_blank" >DAZ</a>, among others. Blender provides a powerful arsenal of tools that enables
advanced 2D and 3D exploration, animation, video editing, and compositing among others. Students that are already familiar
with other 3D suites such as Cinema4D and Maya are ecnouraged to use their software of choice. Although Unity and Unreal
Engine are game engines, if you are comfortable in producing 3D animation work with these engines you are more than
encouraged to do so.
</p> 
<p>You are required to signup for an account on <a 
href="http://sketchfab.com" target="_blank" >Sketchfab</a>, an online 3D model sharing platform. Here you will post your
animated 3D models and scenes for assessment and dissemination among your peers. Sketchfab can also be used as an AR
platform for personal and semester-long projects.
</p> 
<p><a 
href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank" >Discord</a> is used as our primary mode of communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a 
href="https://discord.gg/yk3qpfvbmj" target="_blank" >server</a>, and keep
up to date with announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings, screenings, and
learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
</p> 
<p>You are required to signup for <a 
href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" >YouTube</a> or <a 
href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank" >Vimeo</a>. These platform are used to share your 3D animations in video
format.
</p> 
<p>All required readings and screenings will be posted on our Discord <a 
href="https://discord.gg/yk3qpfvbmj" target="_blank" >server</a>. There is no required book for this class. We will
coordinate and discuss with the department the possibilitites of lab computer use. However, given our current post-COVID
reality, this course is structured such that projects and exercises can be completed with consumer-grade PCs and
laptops.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p> 

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-21000"></a>Projects</h3>
<p>In light of the pandemic and its imposed limitations regarding space, fabrication, and occupying space, the projects have been
designed to permit engagement with the concepts and tools of this course without compromising your physical and mental
health, your peers’, families’, and faculties’. To this end, those interested can use their preferred software, be it Cinema4D or
game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine, as well as other familiar software to explore and engage with this class.
Although this course is primarily built around Blender, students are free to use their DCC of choice to fulfill the requirements
of projects and assignments. However, do note that all of our activities, readings, assignments, and the course in
general, are structured so that your efforts throughout the semester build towards your first and ultimately final
project.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-22000"></a>Project 1: Meta Imaginaries</h4>
<p>The term <em>xenomorph</em> originates from the Greek <em>xeno-</em> meaning “other” or “strange” and <em>-morph</em> which translates to “shape”.
Although the term has been used extensively in popular culture and science fiction, here, it functions in its literal meaning,
”other-form”. The idea behind this project came from Netflix’s series <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Worlds_(TV_series)" target="_blank" >Alien Worlds</a>: a heavily CGI docufiction that speculates
on the possibilities of extraterrestrial ”otherness.” And similarly, for this project, you are tasked to imagine an otherworldly
creature and its habitat.
</p> 
<p>Our work during the first five weeks of class culminates in the realization of this project. Your weekly exercises, challenges,
readings, and discussions are designed to help you navigate and develop your projects. These activities not only satisfy
their own requirements as individual assignments but also feed the progress towards completing Project 1.
During this time, we will model/sculpt our xenomorphs, add materials and textures to them, build engaging
environments and habitats for these creatures with control over lighting, and finally bring them to life by
animating and rigging these characters. These activities not only push you forward in learning the techniques
and standards of the software but also build up towards your Project 1. Week 6 is then dedicated to studio
sessions where you can explore and enhance different aspects of your project before you submit them on Week
7.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-23000"></a>Project 2: Xenoorbis</h4>
<p>Your final project continues to incorporate the techniques, concepts, and theories that we’ve discussed in class. Other
than a few technical requirements, you are in full control of every aspect of your project. You are free to use
any style/technique that you find appropriate for realizing your work. For your final piece you can use your
existing xenomorphs and environments <span class="textul">OR</span> you can start form scratch and create different characters and new
habitats.
</p> 
<p>You are responsible for the ideation, conceptualization, and execution of your work. Extra credit is given to those whose
concepts relate to the readings, screenings, or relevant contemporary debates. You must be able to discuss and contextualize
your idea. In other words, you need to be able to discuss and justify your ideas and creative decisions. Moreover, the
format of your work is also determined by you and can fall within or outside any of the following categories:
non-photorealistic animation (3d, 2.5d), 3d animation, mixed media collage, and experimental animation, among
others.

Create a 5 minutes long presentation about yourself. This should include your previous works, expertise, 
and how/where you want to move forward in your career and practice. If you don’t feel 
comfortable sharing your projects, instead include up to 3 works that interest you conceptually, 
technically, and aesthetically. Your presentations must be made with <a

<li class="itemize"> <b>Challenge: Blender Fundamentals</b> <span class="texthl"><span id="textcolor4"><b>(Due Sun, 01/17)</b></span></span>  <br /> 
Your first challenge is aimed at familiarizing yourself with the software and putting into practice 
some of the techniques and skills that you learn along the way. For this challenge you are 
to watch <a 
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6" target="_blank" >Blender Fundamentals</a>. Try to watch as many of these videos as you can. They 
serve as a perfect entry point to understand the Blender’s capabilities. After you are done 
watching these videos, create a 10 seconds piece of animation at 24fps. Your animation requires 
keyframing the <span class="textul">translation</span>, <span class="textul">rotation</span>, and <span class="textul">scale</span> of a primitive object (e.g. a cube or sphere). 
Anything beyond this is optional, but it would be nice to see your object shiny and nice 
looking 🤯💥👌 . Render your video as a 1080p .mp4 file and submit to our Discord server under

<li class="itemize"><b>Prompt:</b> How do you define critique? What do you think are the most impactful ways of critique 
based on the readings? Why would Leeman suggest to take the time to make “obvious, verifiable 
observations” about a piece of work? After reading Leeman’s piece, how do you see the role of 
critique in your work or art practice? Leeman suggests how little trust the public has in their own 
experience of art viewing. “A person fully capable of noticing and responding to a tree 
outside a gallery crosses the threshold into the gallery and becomes suddenly unable to 
muster that same capacity facing a work of art.” Would you agree with this claim?

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-33000"></a>PPE and Related College Covid Policies</h4>
<p>Safe campus requirements include but are not limited to wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, health symptom
monitoring, participating in contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, and additional safety expectations detailed at
<a 
href="safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank" >safeandhealthy.osu.edu</a>. All Ohio State students, faculty and staff are expected to meet the behavioral and safety
expectations under the Safe Campus Requirements when they physically participate in any university activity, on
or off campus. All students, faculty and staff also will be required to perform a daily health check to report
body temperature each day they intend to be physically on an Ohio State campus. Failure to adhere to these
requirements will be addressed through standard enforcement mechanisms, and an approach built on escalation,
whereby adherence will be reinforced through education, choice and peer support before escalating to disciplinary
action whenever possible. Where violations are serious and/or ongoing, however, they will be addressed as
follows:
</p> 
     
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">A student and/or student organization will be referred for disciplinary action where the student and/or student
organization’s behavior endangers the health or safety of campus community members, on or off campus, and/or
fails to comply with the directives outlined in the Safe Campus Requirements. o During an incident in which
a student is not adhering, the student should first be asked to comply (e.g., to wear a mask). If this does
not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy requirements. If the student
continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave the location and not to return until they are prepared
to follow the requirements.
</li>     
<li class="itemize">For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident should be reported
to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate
tracking. Even if the student’s name is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be made to assist the
university in evaluating adherence efforts; however, it should be acknowledged that Student Conduct will be
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     
unable to take disciplinary action without identifying information.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-34000"></a>COVID-19-Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h4>
<p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required quarantine due to exposure will
transition course activities to distance learning to the extent that they are able during periods of mandated absence. Students
will work with instructors to confirm their ability to participate or alternative learning activities related to course objectives
and assignments will be provided.
</p> 
<p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online interactions and learning at a distance will
occur. All university standards and policies remain in place as related to Title IX, academic misconduct, allowances for
students with disabilities, studio conduct and respect for others, and other related issues. We will be meeting and interacting
in an online format, not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves and treat others as if we are meeting in
person.
</p> 
<p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online delivery mode for the remainder of the
semester.
</p> 
<p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms, or required
quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course continuity. If the instructor is able, the course may
transition to an online delivery mode temporarily.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-35000"></a>Academic Misconduct</h4>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish procedures for the investigation
of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic
misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection
with examinations and artwork created in studio courses. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic
misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the <a 
href="https://studentconduct.osu.edu/for-students/understanding-the-student-conduct-process/" target="_blank" >Code of Student
Conduct</a>
</p> 
<p>The Department of Art adheres to all aspects of this Code of Conduct especially in matters relating to the following:
Academic Misconduct, Endangering Health or Safety, Sexual Misconduct, Destruction of Property, and Theft/Unauthorized
Use of Property.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-36000"></a>Reusing Past Work</h4>
<p>In general, you are prohibited in university courses from turning in work from a past class to your current class, even if you
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
modify it. If you want to build on past research or revisit a topic explored in previous courses, please discuss the situation
with your instructor at the start of the assignment/project.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-37000"></a>Citing Your Sources</h4>
<p>Cite your sources to back up what you say and write. (Use a citation generator if you are unsure of the proper citation
format.) If you use a photograph or are particularly inspired by another work and wish to include, mimic, or apply any part
of it to your work, cite it. We will discuss precedent usage and appropriation in class. While precedent usage is expected to
inspire new iterations and build skills, you are expected to credit your sources and work to distinct and individual challenge
solutions.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-38000"></a>Disability Services</h4>
<p>The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic
barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let us know
immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, we may request that you
register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements with us as soon as possible to discuss
your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. Fore more information contact the SLDS
office.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-39000"></a>Accommodations</h4>
<p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to make <em>reasonable accommodations</em> for
students who are unable to be safely present in the classroom <em>and</em> have been approved for an accommodation by the office of
Student Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture course, such an accommodation might mean streaming lectures on
Zoom or making recordings available to the students. For classes that involve laboratory work, studio work,
or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable accommodation will not always be possible. Students are
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
expected to work with their advisors and, where appropriate, SLDS to find workable solutions to their scheduling
needs.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-40000"></a>Grade Forgiveness</h4>
<p>The Grade Forgiveness Rule allows undergraduate students to petition to repeat up to three courses. The grade in the
repeated course will permanently replace the original grade for the course in the calculation of the student’s cumulative
GPA.
</p> 
<p>Only a first repeat can be used this way; all other repeats of the same course will be included under the general course
repeatability rule.
</p> 
<p>The original grade will remain on the student’s transcript and some graduate/professional school admission
processes will re-calculate the student’s GPA to include the original grade. See: <a 
href="https://advising.osu.edu/grade-forgiveness-0" target="_blank" >Grade Forgiveness</a> for more
information.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-41000"></a>Diversity</h4>
<p>The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body. Our programs and curricula
reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to provide opportunities for students to learn more about
persons who are different from them. We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and
values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect
among each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach <span class="sout">his or her</span> their own
potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status, which is defined as age, color,
disability, gender identity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is
prohibited.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-42000"></a>Sexual Misconduct/Relationship Violence</h4>
<p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same
kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories (e.g.,
race). If you or someone you know has been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate
resources at <a 
href="http://titleix.osu.edu/" target="_blank" >http://titleix.osu.edu</a> or by contacting the Ohio State Title IX Coordinator, Kellie Brennan, at
<a

</p> 

                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-43000"></a>Mental Health Services</h4>
<p>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships,
increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These
mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s
ability to participate in daily activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing
these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the
aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services
available on campus via the Office of Student Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS) by visiting
<a 
href="http://ccs.osu.edu/" target="_blank" >ccs.osu.edu</a> or calling <a 
href="tel:614\-2925766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a>. CCS is located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center and 10th
Floor of Lincoln Tower. You can reach an on call counselor when CCS is closed at <a 
href="tel:614\-292-5766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a> and 24 hour

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-44000"></a>Trigger Language Warning</h4>
<p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to descriptions of and/or scenes
depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence and its aftermath. If needed, please take care of yourself while
watching/reading this material (leaving classroom to take a water/bathroom break, debriefing with a friend, contacting a
Sexual Violence Support Coordinator at <a 
href="tel:6142921111" target="_blank" >614-292-1111</a>, or Counseling and Consultation Services at <a 
href="tel:6142925766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a>, and
contacting the instructor if needed). Expectations are that we all will be respectful of our classmates while consuming this
media and that we will create a safe space for each other. Failure to show respect to each other may result in dismissal from
the class.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-45000"></a>General Class and Studio Policies</h4>
<p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of
race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided
to the instructor and may include the student’s legal name unless changed via the University Name Change policy. We will
gladly honor your request to address you by another name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the semester so
that we may make appropriate changes to our records.
</p> 
<p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language, imagery, or dialogue that may
be challenging or offend some students. While no student is required to participate in a presentation or discussion of art or
design that offends them, it is important to remain open-minded and participate in a cooperative and respectful manner. Art
can often challenge our ideas and experiences, and can lead us into some lively discussion, concepts and imagery.
Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences, etc.) can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and
provocative, so please, engage in the exchange of ideas respectfully. Please see us with your concerns as soon as
