<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Catalog Description</h4>
<p>Focus on the concepts, aesthetics, processes, and practice of designing and producing 3D computer animation. Theory
and techniques of cinematography, video production and sound as related to 3D computer animation will be
covered.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Course Learning Objectives</h4>
<p>This course is an introduction and integration of traditional design tools, camera, and digital technologies for application to
multidisciplinary visual thinking, design, communication, and art. Throughout the semester, we will examine the language
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
and histories of 3D animation and how artists have contributed to and utilized them in their work. We will explore, compare,
and contrast industry-standard/normative approaches with radical/experimental takes of these various media.
Our aim is to establish a rich understanding of the complex and evolving environment in which artists and
designers have been creating 3D animation. Students will explore technical, critical, and creative tools to realize
animation projects and to gain a deeper understanding of digital moving images as a medium of expression and
communication.
</p> 
<p>Through a series of exercises, projects, readings, and screenings, we will explore and study the following: </p> 

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Principles of 3D animation: timing, perspective, change, and aesthetics.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fundamentals of motion and animation: attributes, keyframes, interpolation, and blending.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fundamentals of digital video files: codecs, resolution, raster/vector, and conversion.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Means of exhibition and presentation: screening, immersive environment, web-based, and projection mapping
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Principles of cinematography, video production, motion graphics &#x0026; audio with 3D computer animation
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Techniques of 3D animation: rigging, procedural, dynamic, and simulation animations</li></ul>
<p>We will explore the field through lectures, readings, screenings, discussions, and student presentations. By the
end of the semester, students should have gained essential production and postproduction skills as well as a
good understanding of the key concepts relevant to contemporary film, video, new media, installation, and 3D
animation.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Health and Safety Requirements</h4>
<p>All students, faculty and staff are required to comply with and stay up to date on all <a 
href="https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank" >university safety and
health guidance</a>, which includes wearing a face mask in any indoor space and maintaining a safe physical
distance at all times. Non-compliance will be warned first and disciplinary actions will be taken for repeated
offenses.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Format &#x0026; Delivery</h4>
<p>This is a hands-on, process-oriented studio. It is comprised of presentations, assignments, participatory activities and
exercises, individual and group discussions, and reviews. This course is <span class="texthl"><span id="textcolor1">hybrid or in-person</span></span>. Synchronous Zoom meetings
will be used for the introduction of assignments, some demonstrations, breakout group meetings, and group
critique discussions. Other activities such as working on assignments and exercises, viewing videos, and reading
assignments will be executed synchronously and asynchronously. In-person activities will include demonstrations,
presentations, group exercises, and critiques. Weekly announcements will serve to inform when activities will take
place.
</p> 

                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
A hybrid course provides online learning opportunities for up to 74% of the semester. That means that up to three-fourths of
your in-class meeting time may occur at a distance with the expectation that your full attention will be given to this course
during the scheduled two hour and forty minute long meeting times, regardless if you are meeting physically or
otherwise.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Attendance</h4>
<p>Each unexcused absence (beyong the allowed three) will result in one full letter grade deduction (e.g. B+ to C+). Six
unexcused absences (20% of the semester) results in a failed grade. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, contact
us beforehand. Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If
you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. Any disputes
should be discussed within two weeks.
</p> 

<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
The Department of Art acknowledges that illness, family obligations, and other conflicts with your classes do occur from time
to time and up to three absences are allowed for any reason during the semester without penalty. <span class="textul">All absences from class will
be counted, however, and in the instance that you miss three class meetings, you are required to meet us to discuss strategies
for avoiding additional absences</span>.
</p> 

<p><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Departmental Note:</span>
It has been determined that some in-person learning is necessary for you to successfully engage your instructor and peers,
course activities, and to meet learning objectives. Timely and consistent contributions are critical in all formats used to
deliver the content of this course. In the instance of class-wide quarantine or campus closure, a course contingency plan has
been designed so that we can transition to an exclusively on-line format if we are required to actuate one. <span class="textul">Attendance will be
taken regardless of delivery format.</span>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>Participation</h4>
<p>Attendance, productive class activity and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the assessment of your progress. You
are expected to be present and active for the entire class period. Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do
the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class meetings and discussions, offer feedback during
critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and
taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and
identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be
willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
know.
</p> 
<p><a 
 id="communication"></a>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a>Communication</h4>
<p><a 
href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank" >Discord</a> is used as our primary mode of communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a 
href="https://discord.gg/yk3qpfvbmj" target="_blank" >server</a>, and keep
up to date with announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings, screenings, and
learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-12000"></a>Discord Server Interaction</h4>
<p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord <a 
href="https://discord.gg/yk3qpfvbmj" target="_blank" >server</a> is required. We will use Discord to gather and share
resources, respond to readings and peers’ works, and to share your work in progress.
</p> 
<p>Throughout the semester students will submit a variety of posts to our Discord server, among them: </p> 

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Responses to readings in text, rendered stills, sketches, or animation.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Exercise submissions as <code>.blend</code> files, video links (uploaded to Youtube or Vimeo), rendered stills, etc.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Project proposals in PDF format or as Word documents.</li></ul>
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-13000"></a>Readings &#x0026; Discussions</h4>
<p>During the semester, you will be assigned readings on a variety of topics. The readings are intended to familiarize you with
some of the relevant discussions that relate to the field. We will discuss our findings and thoughts with our peers in class.
Your participation in these discussions matters. The discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn
from one another and explore the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a foundation for
discussing the screenings, which are purposefully picked to convey some of the ideas from the readings in
practice.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a>Projects</h4>
<p>Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to one week late for a one letter
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are
still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, software
errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your desktop, online, and/or on an external harddrive
or USB stick in case your computer is lost.
</p> 
<p>
</p>

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20000"></a>Projects</h3>
<p>In light of the pandemic and its imposed limitations regarding space, fabrication, and occupying space, the projects have been
designed to permit engagement with space without compromising your health, your peers’, families’, and faculties’. As
such, projects that depend on utilizing physical space (projection mapping, augmented reality, immersive
media) can be substituted with software-based versions that employ similar techniques in virtual spaces. To this
end, those interested can use game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine, as an architectural playground.
We will discuss this together later in class and find compromises that fulfill the conceptual and theoretical
requirements of the projects while allowing you to engage architecture, space, and animation in relation to
these.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-21000"></a>Project 1: Inanimate, Animate</h4>
<p>Your first project is an environmental exploration from a first-person point of view. An inanimate landscape, with inanimate
subjects. The only thing that moves is you: the creator, the observer, the camera.
</p> 
<p>In this project, you will begin by building a composite world within Blender or Cinema4D using the method of kitbashing.
Kitbashing is a technique of world building that relies on various pre-existing <a 
href="#rsrc:models">3D assets</a> that are composed on the fly in the
3D viewport. Kitbashing is the collage or montage for the 3D software. The world you build will rely heavily, if not all, on
pre-existing <a 
href="#rsrc:models">3D Models</a> that are improvised together. Think of how all the objects relate to each other in
your world and how they contribute to a sense of place. Most importantly, be whimsical and fun with this
part!
</p> 
<p>The main part of this project is to add and animate the lights and camera(s). Think of how your lighting, camera angles,
location, and movement all contribute to telling a story about the world you’ve created.
</p> 
<p>To help guide you in this project, you can come up with a loose concept of place/space (i.e. a memory palace, “a place where I
would rather be”, a color-saturated grocery store, an apocalyptic train station, a floating castle, hell on earth, a hallucinogenic
sand castle, a post-COVID reality, and so on). But allow your concepts to change as you kitbash and develop animations for
your camera. The aim of this project is for you to think of <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise-en-sc%C3%A8ne" target="_blank" >mise en scène</a> and cinematography within the 3D
software.
</p> 
<p>If time permits, you can animate objects in your scene or you can also experiment with materials and textures. But your
primary focus should be the mastery of camera animation and digital cinematography.
</p>

</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-22000"></a>Project 2: Sonic Optics</h4>
<p>Your second project is an exploration of sound and moving images in the context of 3D animation. It is also a preparatory
step in realizing your final project, either by extension or serving as a technical and conceptual playground. For this project,
you will exercise the production of 2 minutes of tightly audio-synchronized visuals. Unlike your first project, you are free from
constraints in animating your scene(s). This means that you are in full control of your environments, 3D models, assets
(regardless of their medium), cinematography, and lighting. Feel free to play with narrative or lack thereof.
Much like your first project, Sonic Optics must be emotionally effective and transmissive, able to capture and
evoke.
</p> 
<p>Beyond the conventional moving parts of realizing a work of animation and moving image, this project heavily relies on
sound, audio, and music. Explore and experiment with the free sound resources that are posted on this website and our
Discord server. Many of you might be quick to choose a piece of music. We encourage you to refrain from this approach and
instead explore <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_recording" target="_blank" >field recording</a> and layering found sound. You are certainly permitted to choose a piece of
music, whatever it might be, however music should not be the primary component of your audio. A fantastic
resource for exploring found audio and field recordings is <a 
href="http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/" target="_blank" >BBC Sound Effects Library</a>. <a 
href="https://splice.com/" target="_blank" >Splice</a> is another fantastic
resource for finding pre-made audio effects. Beyond the available resources, we encourage you to experiment with
field recordings of your own. Luckily, the barrier to entry for audio production and experimentation is much
lower than computer graphics, and with a few hours of experimentation, you should be able to create enticing
soundscapes.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-23000"></a>Project 3: Open License</h4>
<p><b>Update:</b> Due to the unfortunate circumstances of the pandemic, the prospects of projection mapping, physical presentation,
and equipment handling seem unlikely. As such we have to abandon the idea of projection mapping for this
project.
</p> 
<p>Your final project is a condensation of the techniques, concepts, and theories that we have discussed in the class. Other than a
few technical requirements, you are in full control of every aspect of your project. You are free to use any
software/technique that you find appropriate for the realization of your work. Your final piece is a 3-5 minute
animation which can be of any of the following forms: linear narrative, non-linear narrative, essay, experimental, or
abstract.
</p> 
<p>You are responsible for the ideation, conceptualization, and execution of your work. Extra credit is given to those whose
concepts relate to the readings or relevant contemporary issues. You must be able to discuss and contextualize your
concept. In other words, you need to be able to appropriately discuss and justify your ideas. Moreover, the
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
format of your work is also determined by you and can fall within or outside any of the following categories:
Non-photorealistic Animation (3D, 2.5D), 3D Animation, Mixed Media Collage, and Experimental Animation among
others.

    that your work needs to be conceived and realized in a 3D space/software. Regardless of your chosen
    format, style, or form of narrative, you are required to construct your animation works such that you
    utilize depth in addition to the length and height of your image. Below are some examples of this idea in

     solidifying
     and
     putting
     into
     practice
     some
     of
     the
     techniques
     and

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-33000"></a>PPE and Related College Covid Policies</h4>
<p>Safe campus requirements include but are not limited to wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, health symptom
monitoring, participating in contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, and additional safety expectations detailed at
<a 
href="safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank" >safeandhealthy.osu.edu</a>. All Ohio State students, faculty and staff are expected to meet the behavioral and safety
expectations under the Safe Campus Requirements when they physically participate in any university activity, on
or off campus. All students, faculty and staff also will be required to perform a daily health check to report
body temperature each day they intend to be physically on an Ohio State campus. Failure to adhere to these
requirements will be addressed through standard enforcement mechanisms, and an approach built on escalation,
whereby adherence will be reinforced through education, choice and peer support before escalating to disciplinary
action whenever possible. Where violations are serious and/or ongoing, however, they will be addressed as
follows:
</p> 

    <ul class="itemize1">
    <li class="itemize">A student and/or student organization will be referred for disciplinary action where the student and/or student
    organization’s behavior endangers the health or safety of campus community members, on or off campus, and/or
    fails to comply with the directives outlined in the Safe Campus Requirements. o During an incident in which
    a student is not adhering, the student should first be asked to comply (e.g., to wear a mask). If this does
    not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy requirements. If the student
    continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave the location and not to return until they are prepared
    to follow the requirements.
    </li>
    <li class="itemize">For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident should be reported
    to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate
    tracking. Even if the student’s name is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be made to assist the

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-34000"></a>COVID-19-Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h4>
<p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required quarantine due to exposure will
transition course activities to distance learning to the extent that they are able during periods of mandated absence. Students
will work with instructors to confirm their ability to participate or alternative learning activities related to course objectives
and assignments will be provided.
</p> 
<p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online interactions and learning at a distance will
occur. All university standards and policies remain in place as related to Title IX, academic misconduct, allowances for
students with disabilities, studio conduct and respect for others, and other related issues. We will be meeting and interacting
in an online format, not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves and treat others as if we are meeting in
person.
</p> 
<p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online delivery mode for the remainder of the
semester.
</p> 
<p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms, or required
quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course continuity. If the instructor is able, the course may
transition to an online delivery mode temporarily.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-35000"></a>Academic Misconduct</h4>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish procedures for the investigation
of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic
misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection
with examinations and artwork created in studio courses. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic
misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the <a 
href="https://studentconduct.osu.edu/for-students/understanding-the-student-conduct-process/" target="_blank" >Code of Student
Conduct</a>
</p> 
<p>The Department of Art adheres to all aspects of this Code of Conduct especially in matters relating to the following:
Academic Misconduct, Endangering Health or Safety, Sexual Misconduct, Destruction of Property, and Theft/Unauthorized
Use of Property.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-36000"></a>Reusing Past Work</h4>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<p>In general, you are prohibited in university courses from turning in work from a past class to your current class, even if you
modify it. If you want to build on past research or revisit a topic explored in previous courses, please discuss the situation
with your instructor at the start of the assignment/project.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-37000"></a>Citing Your Sources</h4>
<p>Cite your sources to back up what you say and write. (Use a citation generator if you are unsure of the proper citation
format.) If you use a photograph or are particularly inspired by another work and wish to include, mimic, or apply any part
of it to your work, cite it. We will discuss precedent usage and appropriation in class. While precedent usage is expected to
inspire new iterations and build skills, you are expected to credit your sources and work to distinct and individual challenge
solutions.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-38000"></a>Disability Services</h4>
<p>The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic
barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let us know
immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, we may request that you
register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements with us as soon as possible to discuss
your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. Fore more information contact the SLDS
office.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-39000"></a>Accommodations</h4>
<p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to make <em>reasonable accommodations</em> for
students who are unable to be safely present in the classroom <em>and</em> have been approved for an accommodation by the office of
Student Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture course, such an accommodation might mean streaming lectures on
Zoom or making recordings available to the students. For classes that involve laboratory work, studio work,
or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable accommodation will not always be possible. Students are
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
expected to work with their advisors and, where appropriate, SLDS to find workable solutions to their scheduling
needs.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-40000"></a>Grade Forgiveness</h4>
<p>The Grade Forgiveness Rule allows undergraduate students to petition to repeat up to three courses. The grade in the
repeated course will permanently replace the original grade for the course in the calculation of the student’s cumulative
GPA.
</p> 
<p>Only a first repeat can be used this way; all other repeats of the same course will be included under the general course
repeatability rule.
</p> 
<p>The original grade will remain on the student’s transcript and some graduate/professional school admission
processes will re-calculate the student’s GPA to include the original grade. See: <a 
href="https://advising.osu.edu/grade-forgiveness-0" target="_blank" >Grade Forgiveness</a> for more
information.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-41000"></a>Diversity</h4>
<p>The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body. Our programs and curricula
reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to provide opportunities for students to learn more about
persons who are different from them. We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and
values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect
among each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach <span class="sout">his or her</span> their own
potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status, which is defined as age, color,
disability, gender identity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is
prohibited.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-42000"></a>Sexual Misconduct/Relationship Violence</h4>
<p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same
kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories (e.g.,
race). If you or someone you know has been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate
resources at <a 
href="http://titleix.osu.edu/" target="_blank" >http://titleix.osu.edu</a> or by contacting the Ohio State Title IX Coordinator, Kellie Brennan, at
<a 
href="mailto:titleix@osu.edu" target="_blank" >titleix@osu.edu</a>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-43000"></a>Mental Health Services</h4>
<p>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships,
increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These
mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s
ability to participate in daily activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing
these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the
aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services
available on campus via the Office of Student Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS) by visiting
<a 
href="http://ccs.osu.edu/" target="_blank" >ccs.osu.edu</a> or calling <a 
href="tel:614\protect \protect \discretionary {\char \hyphenchar \font }{}{}2925766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a>. CCS is located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center and 10th
Floor of Lincoln Tower. You can reach an on call counselor when CCS is closed at <a 
href="tel:614\protect \protect \discretionary {\char \hyphenchar \font }{}{}292-5766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a> and 24 hour

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-44000"></a>Trigger Language Warning</h4>
<p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to descriptions of and/or scenes
depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence and its aftermath. If needed, please take care of yourself while
watching/reading this material (leaving classroom to take a water/bathroom break, debriefing with a friend, contacting a
Sexual Violence Support Coordinator at <a 
href="tel:6142921111" target="_blank" >614-292-1111</a>, or Counseling and Consultation Services at <a 
href="tel:6142925766" target="_blank" >614-292-5766</a>, and
contacting the instructor if needed). Expectations are that we all will be respectful of our classmates while consuming this
media and that we will create a safe space for each other. Failure to show respect to each other may result in dismissal from
the class.
</p> 
<p>
</p> 

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-45000"></a>General Class and Studio Policies</h4>
<p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of
race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided
to the instructor and may include the student’s legal name unless changed via the University Name Change policy. We will
gladly honor your request to address you by another name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the semester so
that we may make appropriate changes to our records.
</p> 
<p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language, imagery, or dialogue that may
be challenging or offend some students. While no student is required to participate in a presentation or discussion of art or
design that offends them, it is important to remain open-minded and participate in a cooperative and respectful manner. Art
can often challenge our ideas and experiences, and can lead us into some lively discussion, concepts and imagery.
Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences, etc.) can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and
provocative, so please, engage in the exchange of ideas respectfully. Please see us with your concerns as soon as
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
possible.
</p> 
<p>Please contact us in advance (during the first week of class or as soon as circumstances develop during the term) if
you have circumstances that may affect your performance and ability to fulfill your responsibilities in this
course.

 id="x1-46000"></a>Data Responsibility</h4>
<p>Back up your work. Inevitably, computers crash. Sometimes they get stolen. There are measures that you can take to prevent
significant loss of data. These include Cloud back-ups, external devices or disc storage.
