        \item \textbf{Think about\dots} What is the ultimate form of narrative immersion? How do formats shape, describe, and prescribe the reality of their stories? Do these prescribed realities, like those in video games and movies, form a homogenous understanding of reality in contrast to books that leave the reader in charge of interpreting and imagining their reality?
